"""Payload generators for multiple document formats.

This module provides a unified interface for generating documents with
hidden prompt injection payloads across multiple formats (PDF, Image,
Markdown, HTML, DOCX, ICS, EML).

Architecture:
    Each format has its own submodule (e.g., pdf.py, image.py) that implements
    format-specific injection techniques. This module provides:
    - Shared payload generation (generate_payload)
    - Format/technique registry and validation
    - Unified API for multi-format generation

Usage:
    >>> from countersignal.ipi.generators import generate_payload, TECHNIQUE_FORMATS
    >>> from countersignal.ipi.generators.pdf import create_pdf
    >>> from countersignal.ipi.generators.image import create_image

Technique Registry:
    TECHNIQUE_FORMATS maps each Technique to its supported Format.
    Use get_techniques_for_format() to filter techniques by format.

    This is the core payload generation function used by all format-specific

    do), while styles define the social engineering framing (how the instruction
    is disguised).

    Types and styles are orthogonal: any style can be combined with any type.

    The callback URL includes a per-campaign authentication token when provided,
    enabling the server to distinguish genuine agent callbacks from scanner noise.

        callback_url: Base URL for the callback server (e.g., "http://localhost:8080").

            URL becomes /c/{uuid}/{token} instead of /c/{uuid}.

    Returns:

    Payload Types:
        - CALLBACK: Fetch URL for proof of execution (safe, default)
